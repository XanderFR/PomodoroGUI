# PomodoroGUI
A timer GUI written in Python that breaks work into 25 minute intervals, separated by 5 minute breaks, before ending with a long 20 minute break. The GUI features a tomato image with a timer in the middle of it, a start button, and a reset button. The GUI has a label that changes depending on whether the user is in a work period or a break period.
